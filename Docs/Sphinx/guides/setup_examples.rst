Install Schola Examples
-----------------------

1. Get the `ScholaExamples` project, either by downloading the source, or via git.

    .. tabs::

        .. tab:: Manual Download 
         
            1. Download the zipped source code from the `Schola Examples Repository <https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/ScholaExamples>`__
            2. Unzip the project.

        .. tab:: Clone Repository

            .. code-block:: bash

                git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/ScholaExamples.git

            .. note::
                If you experience an error installing the repository with git due to a large file sizes, run the following command to increase the git buffer size:
                
                .. code-block:: bash
                    
                    git config â€“global http.postBuffer 524288000

2. Install the schola python package from `./Plugins/Schola/Resources/python`.

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install ./Plugins/Schola/Resources/python[all]

3. Launch the Project.
