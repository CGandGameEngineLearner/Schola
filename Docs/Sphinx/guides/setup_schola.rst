Install Schola
--------------

1. Add `Schola` to a project as an Unreal Engine Plugin, either by downloading the source, or via git.

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Download and Install 
         
         1. Create a folder named ``Schola`` in the ``Plugins`` folder of your Unreal Engine project.
         2. Download the zipped source code from the `Schola Repository <https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/Schola>`__
         3. Unzip the repository. Copy the contents of the ``Schola`` folder to the ``Schola`` folder you created in your project.

      .. code-tab:: bash Git Submodule 
         
         git submodule add https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/Schola.git  ./Plugins/Schola

      .. code-tab:: bash Standalone Git Repository
         
         git clone https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/Schola.git ./Plugins

   .. note::
      If you experience an error installing the repository with git due to a large file sizes, run the following command to increase the git buffer size:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         git config â€“global http.postBuffer 524288000

2. Install the schola python package from `/Resources/python`.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install ./Plugins/Schola/Resources/python[all]

3. Launch your project as normal in Unreal Engine. You should see the Schola plugin in the Plugins section of the project settings.


Building Schola from source (Optional)
--------------------------------------

Schola comes bundled with all of its c++ dependencies already. However, if you want to use a different version of a
dependency, or unreal engine you may build them from source.


Building gRPC from source for Schola
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install Prerequisites

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Linux
         
         - `Ubuntu 22.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/>`_ (22.04.4 Desktop x86 64-bit is recommended for reproducibility)
         - `Unreal Engine <https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux>`__ (5.4.4 is recommended for reproducibility)
         - `Python 3.9 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3919/>`_ (3.9.19 is recommended for reproducibility)
     
         .. note::
            While other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can be used, `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`__ is recommended along with the `C/C++ Extension Pack <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools>`_. Please see the `Unreal Engine documentation <https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-code-for-unreal-engine>`_ for more information. 
      
      .. group-tab:: Windows
         
         -  `Git VCS <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_
         -  `Unreal Engine <https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download>`__ (5.4.4 is recommended for reproducibility)
         -  `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_ (2017 with VC++ tools v141 installed, or Visual Studio 2022 with VC++ tools)
         -  `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (used to generate a Visual Studio solution from the ``CMakeLists.txt`` provided with gRPC)
         -  `Strawberry perl <http://strawberryperl.com/>`_ 
         -  `NASM <https://www.nasm.us/>`_

         .. note::
            Some install steps may require adding the above prerequisites to your PATH.

2. Build gRPC using the scripts in `/Resources/Build`, by running the following from the Plugin Root Dir

   .. tabs::

      .. code-tab:: bash Linux
            
         # Install Required Packages for Running the Build Script
         sudo apt update
         sudo apt-get -y install cmake git automake autoconf libtool-bin pkg-config build-essential

         # Change this to your Unreal Engine path
         UE_ROOT="~/UnrealEngine/UE_5.4"
         export UE_ROOT
         bash ./Resources/Build/linux_dependencies.sh
      
      .. note::
         You may need to manually update `libtool-bin` as old versions of `libtool-bin`` may cause errors during install.

      .. code-tab:: batch Windows

         # Change this to your Unreal Engine path if it is different than the default.
         set UE_ROOT="C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.4"
         ./Resources/Build/windows_dependencies.bat

Regenerated Protobuf and gRPC Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Follow the steps in the `Building Schola from source` section to build gRPC from source, and get an up to date version of `protoc.exe`.

2. Run the following command to regenerate the protobuf and gRPC code.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python schola-build-proto --plugin-folder . --add-type-stubs

   .. note::

      The `--add-type-stubs` flag is optional and will generate `.pyi` files for the generated code. This is useful for IDEs that support type stubs for better code completion. However, not all protobuf/gRPC features are supported in the `.pyi` files. If you encounter issues when generating try running without the flag.
